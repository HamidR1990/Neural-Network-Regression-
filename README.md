# Neural Networks (Multi-Layer Perceptron) For Regression


##### This is python code for the neural network algorithm (MLP). In this little project, we design a multil layer perceptron to approximate a unknown real function.




#### The main object of this project is to write an MLP algorithm without using usual libraries, in particular, scikit-learn and other prepared tools.



### Dataset:

"Usa-housing" which is a tradition dataset in elementary steps in machine learning for regression tasks. Its main features are:

+ "Avg. Area Income": means the average income of area inhabitants.
+ "Avg. Area House Age": means the average age of houses in the area.
+ "Avg. Area Number of Rooms": means the average number of rooms of houses in the area.
+ "Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms": means the average number of bedrooms of houses in the area.
+ "Area Population": means the area population.
+ "Price": means the price of the house.
